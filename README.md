### App
This android application is a pretty basic single room chat (based on this tutorial: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-android/#0.) 
but has some extended functionality to log userdata needed for the mentioned study.

### Usage
None of these apps can be used without this repo: https://github.com/antesberger/eyetracking-smartphone-mapping.
The execution of the mentioned python project puts a file onto the android device which serves as a flag allowing this app to start. To bypass this functionality choose the participant name ```test```.

### Branches
* master: Chat version for the participant
* distibution: Version for participants chat partner. Doesn't include any data logging
